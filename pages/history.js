							On a magnificent afternoon, mid-March in 2004, the
							Island Beer Club (IBC) was founded. Jeff “Bones” Wilkens
							(Mbr#1), John “Old Doc” Morton (Mbr#2), John “Cruncher”
							Muncy (Mbr#3) and Wayne “Big Oly” Oldendorph (Mbr#4)
							decided to sample hand-crafted, full-bodied beers from
							local microbreweries in the San Diego, California, area.
							After multiple thirst-quenching stops, our four boys
							ended up at the Ballast Point Brewing Company near the
							University of San Diego campus. It was there that a
							kegerator, on display for sale, caught the guys’
							interest. The thought emerged… “Wouldn’t it be cool if
							we could enjoy a cold, hand-crafted, micro-brewed beer
							without the hassle of traveling off of the “Rock?”
					</p>
						<p className=' indent pt-2 pl-3'>
							Since great ideas require intense thought and
							discussion, our four-man brew crew adjourned to the VFW
							bar in Coronado, CA for further liquid refreshment. At
							the “V” the team agreed to form a beer club. Bones would
							be the “capital” man—he would purchase a kegerator and
							allow his garage to be used for micro brew-beer-sampling
							sessions. Other Club members would purchase kegs of
							beer, as required. Having established the basic charter
							for the club, the guys then adjourned to the Little Club
							bar, in Coronado, to celebrate their brilliant thoughts
							and begin the membership campaign.
					</p>
						<p className=' indent pt-2 pl-3'>
							Our man of action, Bones, purchased the kegerator just a
							few days later. And, on Monday, March 22, 2004, Old Doc
							delivered the first keg, Ballast Point Yellowtail Pale
							Ale. Shortly thereafter, our Original Four designated
							Rob “Crenny” Crenshaw Fifth Founder, who joined in on
							the afternoon beer sampling sessions for Coronado’s new
							beer aficionados. He became Member#5 after he purchased
							his first keg.
					</p>
						<p className=' indent pt-2 pl-3'>
							Meeting at 4 pm, the five grew fond of watching Jerry
							Springer (not much else on the tube at that time) and
							discussing the happenings in the universe. It was here
							that the boys developed the IBC motto—“More Time than
							Money” — to reflect the retired status of most of the
							Beer Club’s stately members. The Founders also developed
							the club’s membership obligation: Buy a keg of
							hand-crafted beer and you are a member. About ten months
							into our new Club activities, we needed to solve a
							problem for Jeff’s spousal unit, Loie (aka Mrs. Bones).
							All this time from inception, Club members were allowed
							to visit the restroom facilities in the house.
							Unfortunately, those waiting outside for the facility to
							“clear” would relieve themselves in Loie’s garden… This
							was intolerable.
					</p>
						<p className=' indent pt-2 pl-3'>
							On the first anniversary of the Beer Club, the first
							urinal was installed. In 2013 the original urinal was
							retired and replaced with a waterless urinal.
							Unfortunately, nowadays, our meeting location may not
							offer a lady’s restroom.
					</p>
						<p className=' indent pt-2 pl-3'>
							Always alert and “forward observant” (looking to the
							future), Bones purchased the domain name,
							www.islandbeerclub.com. He knew that it might be
							worthwhile, but he had no idea what to do with it or how
							it would be helpful… so we sat on it until July of 2006.
							At this point, Crenny had gained some experience in
							website development and was hosting the website for the
							Sea ’N Air Men’s Golf Club. That was all we needed. A
							few pages were developed, and the IBC website was
							officially published in July 2006. This award-winning
							website is the envy of beer clubs everywhere.
					</p>
						<p className=' indent pt-2 pl-3'>
							Signage plays a big part at the Island Beer Club. In
							August 2006, our alley became “Beer Belly Blvd.” A year
							later a permanent brass marker was installed
							commemorating the site of the IBC Headquarters. October
							2007 had John Clampitt (Mbr#18) deliver and install a
							hand-crafted, kiln-fired tile plaque to identify the
							clubhouse of the IBC.
					</p>
						<p className=' indent pt-2 pl-3'>
							John Weiman (Mbr#151), Weiman Design, designed our logo
							in late October 2007; allowing us to acquire our now
							highly sought after, custom apparel and glassware.
					</p>
						<p className=' indent pt-2 pl-3'>
							In our first fourteen years of existence, we have
							continually improved and upgraded the facility to
							include a commercial popcorn maker (compliments of Mike
							Herlihy (Mbr57), two additional beer kegerator’s (thanks
							Bones Mbr#1), a granite wash sink (thanks to IBC plumber
							Bob Ryan (Mbr#120) and granite donator Ed Carney
							(Mbr#58), two flame-thrower outdoor heaters and numerous
							beer-oriented signs. Also, the Island Beer Club banner
							has been on many photo ops including the top of
							Kilimanjaro, 2012 Super Bowl and, a $16 million cocaine
							bust out of Costa Rica. Between, 2011 and 2018, we more
							than tripled our membership as we focused on recruiting
							beer aficionados with enough disposable income to
							provide a keg of hand-crafted beer. As of June 2020, we
							have 407 members.
					</p>
						<p className=' indent pt-2 pl-3'>
							Every March, on the Wednesday closest to 22 March, we
							celebrate the anniversary of the Island Beer Club by
							holding a Founders Day party. This event honors the five
							Founders for creating Coronado’s favorite weekly alley
							beer gathering.
					</p>
						<p className=' indent pt-2 pl-3'>
							We lost Jeffery “Bones” Wilkens, (Mbr#1), on 6 Jul 2019.
							On 7 Aug 2019, a huge turnout joined together in Beer
							Belly Blvd to recognize Jeff, celebrate his life and
							salute his passion for and contribution to the Island
							Beer Club. On 4 Sep 2019 IBC Headquarters, at 851 J Ave,
							was retired and on the same day, we celebrated the Grand
							Opening of the IBC Clubhouse next door at 857 J Ave, Rod
							Neilson’s (Mbr #169) house.
